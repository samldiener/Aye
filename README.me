# Instructions

On this page, click the `Upload Files` button.
Once there, drag and drop your project folder or click `choose your files` link to browse for the project folder.

Next, in the first form field enter a comment for this commit. Something descriptive of what is being updated. The second form field is an optional extended description.

The radio button will either commit the new upload on the master branch, or you can choose to upload it as a new branch if you would like to test a feature without disrupting the master branch.
