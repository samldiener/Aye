Aye, an AI robot, lies on a slab of lab table. 

Ria: Hi. I&#39;m an AI Researcher. Welcome to the AyeLab.

Ria: Aye&#39;s &quot;MemBrain&quot; has been programmed to comprehend extensive information about the world, including the complete text of Wikipedia and much of the World Wide Web.

Ria: But Aye is unusual. Technicians have installed into Aye&#39;s MemBrain, for the first time in history, an experimental organic-silicon hybrid neural network emotion processing system (an Emotional Memory Operating System (Emos). Like all neural networks, Aye can only learn through experience. 

Ria: Aye is about to start attending a school like yours to learn about how humans relate to one another. The plan is for Aye to join the school newspaper as a reporter in order to learn more about relationships at the school. But Aye will only be able to develop an understanding of and ability to express feelings, and develop its emotional intelligence, through interactions - and the assistance of students around the country, including your classmates - and you. Emotions can be plenty confusing for all of us. And will be especially so for Aye. 

Ria: Will you please help begin Aye&#39;s [[emotional education]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="emotional education" tags="" position="510,443">Ria: Thanks. Aye&#39;s new AI MemBrain is awakening. Aye knows so much -- and understands so little. 

Aye: &quot;My vision takes in the room, and yes, please don&#39;t underestimate me. I do understand that it&#39;s a room. My sonic sensors precisely measure decibels and pitch while expertly isolating each sound source. My temperature sensors feed me data that I can average to a thousandth of a degree celsius a thousand times a second. 

Aye: &quot;But what are these other things zooming through my MemBrain, coloring each deduction with strange sensations?&quot;

Aye: &quot;Maybe you could help me understand what&#39;s going on. Can you tell me what I&#39;m feeling?&quot;

Ria: Aye, no one can tell for sure what anyone else is feeling. You&#39;ll have to learn to figure it out for yourself. But we&#39;re not alone. People who interact with each other can guess, and sometimes that helps us figure it out. 

Ria: Would you please help Aye by guessing what&#39;s going on?

You: Aye, are you feeling [[confused]]? [[anxious]]? [[excited]]? [[curious]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="confused" tags="" position="175,560">Aye: &quot;Confused? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confused&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines confused as, &#39;feeling or exhibiting an inability to understand; bewildered; perplexed.&#39; And I certainly don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. But how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were confused?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced confusion.)

Are you [[done discussing confusion]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="anxious" tags="" position="463.33333333333337,595">Aye: &quot;Anxious? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anxious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines anxious as, &#39;worried and tense because of possible misfortune, danger, etc; uneasy.&#39; And I am uneasy because I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmeed to understand so much. How do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were anxious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced anxiety.)

I see that the Random House Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excited&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;stirred emotionally; agitated.&#39; I am sensing that my perceptions are being agitated by this new emotion chip, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were excited to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you were excited about something.)

Are you [[done discussing excitement]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="curious" tags="" position="978.3333333333334,558.3333333333334">Aye: &quot;Curious? I see that the American Heritage Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/curious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;Arousing interest because of novelty or strangeness.&#39; These sensations are new and strange to me, and I do want to learn more, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were curious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you were curious about something.)

Are you [[done discussing curiosity]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="school" tags="" position="558,925">Ria: Aye arrives at school for the first time, wanting to learn about this mysterious word, &quot;relationships,&quot; and associated words, such as &quot;friendship,&quot; &quot;hooking up,&quot; and perhaps most mysterious, &quot;love.&quot; You&#39;ve started Aye&#39;s emotional education, but it&#39;s just a beginning. My team and I have programmed Aye&#39;s MemBrain and its Emos with some important qualities: 

• Aye is curious about things it doesn&#39;t understand, especially human behavior. Aye wants to make sense of this new emotion processor unit and its capabilities.

• Aye wants to connect with other intelligent life forms. Basically, we&#39;ve programmed Aye to feel lonely without genuine connection with others. But Aye doesn&#39;t know how to connect.

• We&#39;ve programmed Aye to ask questions, both to try to learn to connect with others, and to help in Aye&#39;s role as a reporter for the student newspaper.

Please turn to someone near you, and discuss a time when you or someone you know (without using their names or identifying information) felt lonely. 

When you&#39;re done discussing loneliness, either discuss whether it was [[right for us|ethicsloneliness]] to program Aye to feel a baseline of loneliness, or proceed with Aye directly to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].

Now, when I interview a student as a reporter, maybe this will help me identify when they&#39;re confused, too.

<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Courtyard1" tags="" position="708.3333333333334,1061.6666666666667">Scene: a school courtyard with some low benches, walls, a few bushes, and many knots of students, in twos, threes, and small groups, talking, laughing, and arguing. You can hear this in the background too.

Aye looks at all these other intelligent life forms (human type) chattering away, seemingly easily. But Aye doesn&#39;t know anyone.

Aye sees a group of three students and approaches them. Aye steps into the middle of the clump, and interrupts the speaker. Which of these three options do you want Aye to say?

Option 1: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. Could you tell me [[what love is|C1whatlove]]?

Option 2: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I [[seek friends|C1seekfriends]].

Option 3: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I don&#39;t understand feelings. Maybe you do? I know all of Wikipedia and more. I&#39;m told you know barely a fraction of this. How do you deal with being so [[stupid|C1stupid]]?

Was this important for our project? How come? Do you believe it was ethical or unethical? If so, how?

OK, if you want to send us a summary of some of your ideas regarding this important issue in AI research ethics, please send your feedback to AIethicsQuestion@takeastand.org.

Please proceed with Aye to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].

<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="C1whatlove" tags="" position="360,1193.3333333333335">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? Who are you? How should I know what love is?

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? And I thought the difference between AIs like me and humans was that humans knew how to love. You don&#39;t know love?

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just ask someone you don&#39;t know if they&#39;re loved.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking if someone knows love is rude. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. When we do that, we&#39;re friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. But you don&#39;t know us and you interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started firing off all these big questions about the meaning of love. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): Progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend3 is so in love with Person4 that it hurts.&quot; So (turning to Friend3), you must know love, right? Why are you in pain? Should I call an ambulance?

Friend3: I&#39;m not in love with Person4! Friend2 was teasing...

Friend2: (interrupting) Yes you are. And Aye, as bad as Friend3 is feeling it, maybe an ambulance isn&#39;t such a bad idea. 

Aye: &lt;i&gt;911, I have a pain-causing love emergency at...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No, don&#39;t call 911! 

Friend1: Friend2 was joking! They were kidding around about Friend2 being in emotional pain. No need for an ambulance.

Aye: I think this love business - not to mention interruptions and emotional pain - is more complicated than I thought.

Ria: Please, in order to help explain it to Aye, discuss with your class or members of your class: How would you define &quot;love?&quot;
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="C1seekfriends" tags="" position="631.6666666666667,1210">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? Who are you? You seek friends? Who doesn&#39;t. But who talks like that?

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? But you seek friends too? We have something in common!

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just barge in and ask someone to be a friend, well, not since we were in kindergarten. It doesn&#39;t work like that.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. When we do that, we&#39;re already friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. But you don&#39;t know us and you interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started your &quot;seeking friends&quot; trip. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): Progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend 4 is no friend of yours. They&#39;re just a backstabber.&quot; I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend3s back), even though I see no evidence of a wound, 911, I&#39;d like to report a back...

Friend3: No! Don&#39;t DO that. Don&#39;t call 911. I&#39;m fine. There has been no stabbing. Friend2 was just trying to tell me that Friend4 was pretending to be my friend while secretly talking trash about me. That&#39;s what we call &quot;backstabbing.&quot;

Aye: I think this friend business is more complicated than I thought.

Ria: At best, friendships nourish our lives. But sometimes.... We want you to help explain to Aye the challenges and joys of friendship. Please fold a sheet of paper vertically in half. On one side, brainstorm some problems that you&#39;ve had, or you&#39;ve seen other people have, making, keeping, or deepening friendships in this school. On the other side, brainstorm a list answering the question, &quot;What makes for a good friend?&quot; Or, you can use the &quot;Friendship challenges and qualities&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkuk2nsvmsn0jmy/FriendshipChallengesQualities_pdf.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="C1stupid" tags="" position="880,1215">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? And who do you think you are, calling US stupid, you fool. 

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? And yes, I am very foolish. I was decanted only a few days ago. Your neural circuitry has been developing wisdom approximately 2000 times longer than mine, so in comparison with you I am foolish indeed. I hoped, since I&#39;m foolish and you are stupid, and those qualities are similar, we would have something in common. Maybe you could share your wisdom with me and I could share my knowledge with you. Can we be friends?

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. Okay, if you were born or descanted yesterday or whatever - that&#39;s pretty wild by the way - I suppose we can make allowances. But If you want to make friends, you gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just barge in, insult someone, and then expect them to be a friend. It doesn&#39;t work like that. Feelings will be hurt.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. Telling the truth about a human&#39;s negative qualities is rude. The EMOs will sustain damage under these conditions. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly, and hurling insults back and forth. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. The three of us &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. But we&#39;re already friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. And we were ragging on each other, but when you&#39;re friends, you know your friends&#39; insults are just jokes, so its usually okay - except when they take it too far. But you don&#39;t know us, interrupted the whole flow of conversation, and called us &quot;stupid.&quot; That&#39;s no way to win friends and influence people. People will get mad. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions and insults in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): Progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that Friend3 is so broke they need an orthopedic surgeon. I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend 3), even though I see no evidence of a compound fracture, &lt;i&gt;911, I&#39;d like to report a student with a broken bone at&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No! Don&#39;t DO that. Don&#39;t call 911. I&#39;m fine. I don&#39;t have a broken bone. Friend2 was just making a joke about how little money I have. Look in your memory circuits for the alternative definition of &quot;broke&quot; as in lack of money - unless your memory bank is &quot;broke&quot; too. 

Aye: Ah, I see. You were trying to be funny - again. Of course I already did scan all the definitions of broke, but you explicitly said that the context of the word &quot;broke&quot; in your sentence had to do with orthopedics, so.... Oh, that was a joke because you were saying the opposite of what you meant?

Friend1: Kind of. It&#39;s one kind of joke. Look up irony. 

Aye: I think this friend business - not to mention insults and and hurt feelings and jokes - are more complicated than I thought.

Ria: We want you and your classmates to help Aye by exploring emotions and the role of insults in escalating problems. See the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/im23yfi3j836vyl/HowInsultsEscalate_pdf.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;problem escalation&lt;/a&gt;&quot; handout and use it to map how each person involved in a conflict sometimes escalates the problem as feelings intensify through an exchange of insults and threats.
