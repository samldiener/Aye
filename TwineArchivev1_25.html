Aye, an AI robot, lies on a slab of lab table. 

Ria: Hi. I&#39;m an AI Researcher. Welcome to the AyeLab.

Ria: Aye&#39;s &quot;MemBrain&quot; has been programmed to comprehend extensive information about the world, including the complete text of Wikipedia and much of the World Wide Web.

Ria: But Aye is unusual. Technicians have installed into Aye&#39;s MemBrain, for the first time in history, an experimental organic-silicon hybrid neural network emotion processing system (an Emotional Memory Operating System (Emos). Like all neural networks, Aye can only learn through experience. 

Ria: Aye is about to start attending a school like yours to learn about how humans relate to one another. The plan is for Aye to join the school newspaper as a reporter in order to learn more about relationships at the school. But Aye will only be able to develop an understanding of and ability to express feelings, and develop its emotional intelligence, through interactions - and the assistance of students around the country, including your classmates - and you. Emotions can be plenty confusing for all of us. And will be especially so for Aye. 

Ria: Will you please help begin Aye&#39;s [[emotional education]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="emotional education" tags="" position="358,275">Ria: Thanks. Aye&#39;s new AI MemBrain is awakening. Aye knows so much -- and understands so little. 

Aye: &quot;My vision takes in the room, and yes, please don&#39;t underestimate me. I do understand that it&#39;s a room. My sonic sensors precisely measure decibels and pitch while expertly isolating each sound source. My temperature sensors feed me data that I can average to a thousandth of a degree celsius a thousand times a second. 

Aye: &quot;But what are these other things zooming through my MemBrain, coloring each deduction with strange sensations?&quot;

Ria: Those are emotions, Aye. Emotions are the tools we use to figure out what&#39;s important to us and to understand and connect with other people.  The more emotional tools we have in our toolbox, the better equipped we are to understand ourselves, communicate our feelings to others, understand other people, and understand their motivations. There&#39;s an old saying, &quot;If you believe the only tool you have is a hammer, you&#39;ll treat every problem as if it&#39;s a nail.&quot; Aye, the more you develop your emotional vocabulary, the better you&#39;ll be at figuring out how to use your EMOs -- and make friends. 

Aye: Okay. Could you help me out by teaching me about some of these emotions?

Ria: I&#39;d like you to help Aye by brainstorming a list of feelings. You can do this by taking out a piece of paper and dividing it verticaly. On the left hand, list as many feelings words as you can that describe your reactions to situations in which you percieve your needs are being met. On the right hand column, list as many emotions as you can that describe your reactions to situations in which you sense your needs are not being met. After brainstorming the list, please discuss, which are the seven most important emotions you believe Aye might want to focus on learning?

When you&#39;re done brainstorming, please [[continue|emotionlists]].

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="confused" tags="" position="175,560">Aye: &quot;Confused? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confused&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines confused as, &#39;feeling or exhibiting an inability to understand; bewildered; perplexed.&#39; And I certainly don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. But how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were confused?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced confusion.)

Are you [[done discussing confusion]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="anxious" tags="" position="463,595">Aye: &quot;Anxious? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anxious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines anxious as, &#39;worried and tense because of possible misfortune, danger, etc; uneasy.&#39; And I am uneasy because I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmeed to understand so much. How do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were anxious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

I see that the Random House Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excited&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;stirred emotionally; agitated.&#39; I am sensing that my perceptions are being agitated by this new emotion chip, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were excited to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

I see that the American Heritage Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/curious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;Arousing interest because of novelty or strangeness.&#39; These sensations are new and strange to me, and I do want to learn more, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were curious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you were curious about something.)

Are you [[done discussing curiosity]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="school" tags="" position="558,925">Ria: Aye arrives at school for the first time, wanting to learn about this mysterious word, &quot;relationships,&quot; and associated words, such as &quot;friendship,&quot; &quot;hooking up,&quot; and perhaps most mysterious, &quot;love.&quot; 

You&#39;ve started Aye&#39;s emotional education, but it&#39;s just a beginning. My team and I have programmed Aye&#39;s MemBrain and its EMOs with some important qualities: 

• Aye is curious about things it doesn&#39;t understand, especially human behavior. Aye wants to make sense of this new EMOs emotion processor unit and its capabilities.

• Aye wants to connect with other intelligent life forms. Basically, we&#39;ve programmed Aye to feel lonely absent genuine connection with others. But Aye doesn&#39;t know how to connect - yet. We&#39;re hoping you&#39;ll help Aye with this.

• We&#39;ve programmed Aye to ask questions, both to try to learn to connect with others, and to help Aye succeed as a reporter for the student newspaper.

Ria: I once heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/desmond-tutus-daughter-leaves-clergy-after-marrying-female-partner&quot;&gt;Mpho Andrea Tutu&lt;/a&gt;, a former minister, lesbian human rights activist, and daughter of the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, explain that in South Africa, there is a tradition for the parents to feed their children by giving all the food to the eldest child, saying, &quot;People are people only through other people,&quot; and relying on that child to distribute the food fairly to all the children. Please turn to someone near you, and discuss:
	1) What do you think the proverb/injunction means? What lessons do you believe you&#39;d learn as a child if you were taught that? In what ways do you agree and/or disagree with that South African saying?
	2) We are all social beings. And yet, everyone feels lonely at some times. Please describe a time when you or someone you know (without using their names or identifying information) felt lonely. 

Ria: When you&#39;re done discussing loneliness, either discuss whether it was [[right for us|ethicsloneliness]] to program Aye to feel a baseline of loneliness, or proceed with Aye directly to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="done discussing confusion" tags="" position="188,733">Aye: I&#39;m still confused about confusion, but that helps to know, thanks. Now, when I interview a student as a reporter, maybe this will help me identify when they&#39;re confused, too.

I&#39;m eager to check out this place called [[school]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="9" name="done discussing anxiety" tags="" position="468,731">Aye: I&#39;m still anxious about not knowing what&#39;s going to happen, and not being in control of this situation, but that helps to know, thanks.

Aye looks at all these other intelligent life forms (human type) chattering away, seemingly easily. But Aye doesn&#39;t know anyone.

Aye sees a group of three students and approaches them. Aye steps into the middle of the clump, and interrupts the speaker. Which of these three options does Aye choose?

Option 1: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. Could you tell me [[what love is|C1whatlove]]?

Option 2: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I [[seek friends|C1seekfriends]].

Option 3: 
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I don&#39;t understand feelings. Maybe you do? I know all of Wikipedia and more. I&#39;m told you know barely a fraction of this. How do you deal with being so [[stupid|C1stupid]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="ethicsloneliness" tags="optional" position="293,973">Please talk with a classmate about how you feel about us programming Aye with a baseline of loneliness - and a motivation to want to make social connections. 

Was this important for our project? Is loneliness important for human beings? Do you believe it was ethical and/or unethical for us to program Aye this way? If so, in what ways?

OK, if you want to send us a summary of some of your ideas regarding this important issue in AI research ethics, please send your feedback to AIethicsQuestion@takeastand.org.

Please proceed with Aye to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].

<tw-passagedata pid="14" name="C1whatlove" tags="" position="286,1205">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? Who are you? How should I know what love is?

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? And I thought the difference between AIs like me and humans was that humans knew how to love. You don&#39;t know love?

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just ask someone you don&#39;t know if they&#39;re loved.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking if someone knows love is rude. But I was listening to you three as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. When we do that, we&#39;re friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. But Aye, you don&#39;t know us. You interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started firing off all these big questions about the meaning of love. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): That&#39;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend3 is so in love with Person4 that it hurts.&quot; So (turning to Friend3), you must know love, right? Why are you in pain? Should I call an ambulance?

Friend3: I&#39;m not in love with Person4! Friend2 was teasing...

Friend2: (interrupting) Yes you are. And Aye, as bad as Friend3 is feeling it, maybe an ambulance isn&#39;t such a bad idea. 

Aye: &lt;i&gt;911, I have a pain-causing love emergency at...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No, don&#39;t call 911! 

Friend1: Friend2 was joking! Friend2 was kidding around because Friend3 has a crush which they don&#39;t want to admit, and Friend3 is unsure about how the person they like feels about them. So, Friend3 is experiencing emotional pain, but they&#39;ll be fine. No emergency. No need for an ambulance.

Aye: I think this love business - not to mention interruptions and emotional pain - is more complicated than I thought.

Ria: Please, in order to help explain it to Aye, discuss with your class or members of your class: How would you define &quot;love?&quot; We know that people have been struggling to define love for millenia, so this isn&#39;t an easy question. But Aye could really use some help here. To start, write down some notes as individuals first, about, for example, how people know they&#39;re in love, experience love, show love, express love, communicate love, feel loved, and sustain love. Then, try to synthesize your answers into an initial definition of love. We&#39;d love to hear and publish your class&#39;s answers to this question, so please share your synthesized answers with initiallovedefs@takeastand.org. 

Are you done [[brainstorming and synthesizing|healthyunhealthy]] definitions of love? 
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="15" name="C1seekfriends" tags="" position="631,1209">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? Who are you? You seek friends? Who doesn&#39;t. But who talks like that?

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? But you seek friends too? We have something in common!

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just barge in and ask someone to be a friend. Well, not since kindergarten. It doesn&#39;t work like that.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. When we do that, we&#39;re already friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. But, Aye, you don&#39;t know us. You interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started your &quot;seeking friends&quot; trip. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine - for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): That&#39;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend 4 is no friend of yours. They&#39;re just a backstabber.&quot; I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend3s back), even though I see no evidence of a wound, &lt;i&gt;911, I&#39;d like to report a back...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No! Don&#39;t DO that. Don&#39;t call 911. I&#39;m fine. There has been no stabbing. Friend2 was just trying to tell me that Friend4 was pretending to be my friend while secretly talking trash about me. That&#39;s what we call &quot;backstabbing.&quot;

Aye: I think this friend business is more complicated than I thought.

Ria: At best, friendships nourish our lives. But sometimes.... We want you to help explain to Aye the challenges and joys of friendship. Please fold a sheet of paper vertically in half. On one side, brainstorm some problems that you&#39;ve had, or you&#39;ve seen other people have, making, keeping, or deepening friendships in this school. On the other side, brainstorm a list answering the question, &quot;What makes for a good friend?&quot; Or, you can use the &quot;Friendship challenges and qualities&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/lkuk2nsvmsn0jmy/FriendshipChallengesQualities_pdf.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;handout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Are you done [[brainstorming and discussing|healthyunhealthy]] the problems and qualities of friendship?
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="C1stupid" tags="" position="880,1215">Friend1: What? Hey, what&#39;s up with the interruption? And who do you think you are, calling US stupid, you fool. 

Aye: I told you. I&#39;m Aye. You don&#39;t like being interrupted? How come? And yes, I am very foolish. I was decanted only a few days ago. Your neural circuitry has been developing wisdom approximately 2000 times longer than mine, so in comparison with you I am foolish indeed. I hoped, since I&#39;m foolish and you are stupid, and those qualities are similar, we would have something in common. Maybe you could share your wisdom with me and I could share my knowledge with you. Can we be friends?

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. Okay, if you were born or descanted yesterday or whatever - that&#39;s pretty wild by the way - I suppose we can make allowances. But If you want to make friends, you gotta learn, you&#39;re being rude. And you can&#39;t just barge in, insult someone, and then expect them to be a friend. It doesn&#39;t work like that. Feelings will be hurt.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. Telling the truth about a human&#39;s negative qualities is rude. The EMOs will sustain damage under these conditions. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly, and hurling insults back and forth. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. The three of us &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#39;s sentences. But we&#39;re already friends, and we&#39;re building on the conversation we&#39;re having, so usually it&#39;s not rude. And we were ragging on each other. When you&#39;re friends, you know your friends&#39; insults are just jokes - so it&#39;s usually okay - except when they take it too far. But Aye, you don&#39;t know us, you interrupted the whole flow of conversation, and then, while bragging, called us &quot;stupid.&quot; That&#39;s no way to win friends and influence people. People will get mad. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, Bragging - not cool. Interruptions and insults in the flow of conversations with friends - mostly fine. But I&#39;m no one&#39;s friend, so it&#39;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#39;s just sad. We&#39;re talking now. Maybe we&#39;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): That&#39;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that Friend3 is so broke they need an orthopedic surgeon. I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend 3), even though I see no evidence of a compound fracture, &lt;i&gt;911, I&#39;d like to report a student with a broken bone at&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No! Don&#39;t DO that. Don&#39;t call 911. I&#39;m fine. I don&#39;t have a broken bone. Friend2 was just making a joke about how little money I have. Look in your memory circuits for the alternative definition of &quot;broke&quot; as in lack of money - unless your memory bank is &quot;broke&quot; too. 

Aye: Ah, I see. You were trying to be funny - again. Of course I already did scan all the definitions of broke, but you explicitly said that the context of the word &quot;broke&quot; in your sentence had to do with orthopedics, so.... Oh, that was a joke because you were saying the opposite of what you meant?

Friend1: Kind of. It&#39;s one kind of joke. Look up irony. 

Aye: I think this friend business - not to mention insults and and hurt feelings and jokes - are more complicated than I thought.

Ria: We want you and your classmates to help Aye by exploring emotions and the role of insults in escalating problems. See the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/im23yfi3j836vyl/HowInsultsEscalate_pdf.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;problem escalation&lt;/a&gt;&quot; handout and use it to map how each person involved in a conflict sometimes escalates the problem as feelings intensify through an exchange of insults and threats. 

Have you finished discussing [[escalation|healthyunhealthy]]?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="emotionlists" tags="" position="663,310">Ria: After brainstorming and discussing your list, please see this organized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4mr1lw543177ez/feelings_inventoryCNVC2005.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;list of emotions&lt;/a&gt; developed by the Center for Nonviolent Communications. Once again, I want you to help Aye out by discussing with each other how come the CNVC folks didn&#39;t describe one side of the sheet as &quot;negative emotions.&quot; What use are all those feelings that most people call &quot;negative,&quot; but the CNVC classifies differently?

((In the curriculum, I&#39;d suggest playing a classroom game here: feelings charades - I&#39;m not sure how to denote that within this app)).

Ria: As Aye plays that game, what do you think Aye might learn about understanding human emotions?

We&#39;ve also played two songs for Aye, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/5336946&quot;&gt;What a Wonderful World&lt;/a&gt;, by Louis Armstrong, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/Everybody_Hurts_REM&quot;&gt;Everybody Hurts&lt;/a&gt;, by REM. Please discuss: What might these songs teach Aye about how humans experience emotions?

Please [[proceed|emotionlist2]] to learn how Aye reacts to these songs, the emotion charades game, and the emotion list.
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="emotionlist2" tags="" position="498,418">Aye: Whoa. Those songs churn up a lot, and there&#39;s an awful lot of feelings on that list. And I think I&#39;m feeling a lot of those all at once. Maybe you could help me understand what&#39;s going on with me. Please tell me, which of these describes what I&#39;m feeling?

Ria: Aye, no one can tell for sure what anyone else is feeling. Only you can do that. But you&#39;re not alone. None of us are. Other people can show they care about us by guessing what we&#39;re feeling. Sometimes their guesses, even if they&#39;re wrong, help us figure out what&#39;s really going on for us. 

Ria: Would you please help Aye by guessing what&#39;s going on?

You: Aye, are you feeling [[confused]]? [[anxious]]? [[excited]]? [[curious]]?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="19" name="healthyunhealthy" tags="" position="526,1417">Aye: This has been really helpful. I&#39;m starting to learn from you about the complications of emotions, the challenges of friendship, what to look for in a good friend, how to prevent problems with friends (and non-friends) from escalating, ways to de-escalate problems, and even ideas about what love is. I&#39;m grateful to you. But my memory banks have also scanned all these testimonies about young people who inflicted violence and abuse on others in relationships, and scanned the [[statistics too|https://www.dropbox.com/s/tysz46ywuezzee2/TDVprevalenceData2013.docx?dl=0]]. 

(insert fact sheet about prevalence of teen dating violence here. For now, I linked above to some notes I took on the [[2013 YRBS|https://www.dropbox.com/s/wg9rdaz6n8kc2xd/TeenDatingViolenceDataFromYRBS2013.pdf?dl=0]] and teen dating violence, which is a good source, but not the only source.)

Aye: I&#39;m confused. I&#39;m hearing that friendships and relationships and love are so great and we all need them. But they&#39;re also full of risk, and I don&#39;t just mean the risk of getting rejected (though I&#39;m worried about how I&#39;d handle that, too). So, I&#39;m also scared. What if I get in a relationship and it&#39;s abusive? What if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; act in an abusive way? And how can I tell the difference between healthy and abusive relationships?

Ria: We&#39;d like you to help Aye out. Please use these mostly blank healthy and abusive relationship pizza wheels and fill in the &quot;slices.&quot;

Would you like to help define and describe:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/5lz4u75e96fn5cr/Healthy_Wheel_Blank.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;healthy relationships&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qr8xocegxepqnd6/Abuse_Wheels_Blank.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;unhealthy ones&lt;/a&gt;?

Please discuss with your class, or members of the class, these characteristics, and then [[proceed|filledinwheels]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="20" name="filledinwheels" tags="" position="526,1567">Aye: Thanks for creating and discussing your version of the healthy and abusive relationship &quot;pizzas&quot; with me. I appreciate it and hearing your ideas gives me more confidence as I think about how to make healthy friendships. 

Ria: Please share your preliminary relationship pizzas with us at preliminarypizzas@takeastand.org for us to share with other schools around the country. We call these preliminary because towards the end of working on this curriculum, we&#39;ll ask you again and see if you want to add/change your pizzas and send us your version of finalpizzas@takeastand.org.

Ria: Here is an example of filled in healthy and abusive relationship &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/unv3ryfsejs5wxx/HealthyAbusiveRelationshipPizzas.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;pizzas&lt;/a&gt;&quot; synthesized from suggestions made by students who we&#39;ve discussed this with before. 

Ria: Now, please join Aye in the school auditorium, where we&#39;ll hear Al Vernacchio in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/al_vernacchio_sex_needs_a_new_metaphor_here_s_one&quot;&gt;TED Talk&lt;/a&gt; about relationships - and pizza, called: &quot;Sex Needs a New Metaphor.
