Aye, an AI robot, lies on a slab of lab table. 

Ria: Hi. I&#39;m an AI Researcher. Welcome to the AyeLab.

Ria: Aye&#39;s &quot;MemBrain&quot; has been programmed to comprehend extensive information about the world, including the complete text of Wikipedia and much of the World Wide Web.

Ria: But Aye is unusual. Technicians have installed into Aye&#39;s MemBrain, for the first time in history, an experimental organic-silicon hybrid neural network emotion processing system (an Emotional Memory Operating System (Emos). Like all neural networks, Aye can only learn through experience. 

Ria: Aye is about to start attending a school like yours to learn about how humans relate to one another. The plan is for Aye to join the school newspaper as a reporter in order to learn more about relationships at the school. But Aye will only be able to develop an understanding of and ability to express feelings, and develop its emotional intelligence, through interactions - and the assistance of students around the country, including your classmates - and you. Emotions can be plenty confusing for all of us. And will be especially so for Aye. 

Ria: Will you please help begin Aye&#39;s [[emotional education]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="emotional education" tags="" position="510,443">Ria: Thanks. Aye&#39;s new AI MemBrain is awakening. Aye knows so much -- and understands so little. 

Aye: &quot;My vision takes in the room, and yes, please don&#39;t underestimate me. I do understand that it&#39;s a room. My sonic sensors precisely measure decibels and pitch while expertly isolating each sound source. My temperature sensors feed me data that I can average to a thousandth of a degree celsius a thousand times a second. 

Aye: &quot;But what are these other things zooming through my MemBrain, coloring each deduction with strange sensations?&quot;

Aye: &quot;Maybe you could help me understand what&#39;s going on. Can you tell me what I&#39;m feeling?&quot;

Ria: Aye, no one can tell for sure what anyone else is feeling. You&#39;ll have to learn to figure it out for yourself. But we&#39;re not alone. People who interact with each other can guess, and sometimes that helps us figure it out. 

Ria: Would you please help Aye by guessing what&#39;s going on?

You: Aye, are you feeling [[confused]]? [[anxious]]? [[excited]]? [[curious]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="confused" tags="" position="175,560">Aye: &quot;Confused? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confused&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines confused as, &#39;feeling or exhibiting an inability to understand; bewildered; perplexed.&#39; And I certainly don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. But how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were confused?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced confusion.)

Are you [[done discussing confusion]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="anxious" tags="" position="461.6666666666667,596.6666666666667">Aye: &quot;Anxious? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anxious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines anxious as, &#39;worried and tense because of possible misfortune, danger, etc; uneasy.&#39; And I am uneasy because I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmeed to understand so much. How do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were anxious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced anxiety.)

I see that the Random House Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excited&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;stirred emotionally; agitated.&#39; I am sensing that my perceptions are being agitated by this new emotion chip, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were excited to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you were excited about something.)

<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="curious" tags="" position="918.3333333333334,588.3333333333334">Aye: &quot;Curious? I see that the American Heritage Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/curious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;Arousing interest because of novelty or strangeness.&#39; These sensations are new and strange to me, and I do want to learn more, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were curious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Ria: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you were curious about something.)

Are you [[done discussing curiosity]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="school" tags="" position="558,925">Ria: Aye arrives at school for the first time, wanting to learn about this mysterious word, &quot;relationships,&quot; and associated words, such as &quot;friendship,&quot; &quot;hooking up,&quot; and perhaps most mysterious, &quot;love.&quot; You&#39;ve started Aye&#39;s emotional education, but it&#39;s just a beginning. My team and I have programmed Aye&#39;s MemBrain and its Emos with some important qualities: 

• Aye is curious about things it doesn&#39;t understand, especially human behavior. Aye wants to make sense of this new emotion processor unit and its capabilities.

• Aye wants to connect with other intelligent life forms. Basically, we&#39;ve programmed Aye to feel lonely without genuine connection with others. But Aye doesn&#39;t know how to connect.

• We&#39;ve programmed Aye to ask questions, both to try to learn to connect with others, and to help in Aye&#39;s role as a reporter for the student newspaper.

Please turn to someone near you, and discuss a time when you or someone you know (without using their names or identifying information) felt lonely. 

When you&#39;re done discussing loneliness, either discuss whether it was [[right for us|ethicsloneliness]] to program Aye to feel a baseline of loneliness, or proceed with Aye directly to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].

<tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Courtyard1" tags="" position="706.6666666666667,1036.6666666666667">Scence: a school courtyard with some low benches, walls, a few bushes, and many knots of students, in twos, threes, and small groups, talking, laughing, and arguing. You can hear this in the background too.

Aye looks at all these other intelligent life forms (human type) chattering away, seemingly easily. But Aye doesn&#39;t know anyone.

Aye sees a group of three students and approaches them. Aye steps into the middle of the clump, and interrupts the speaker. What do you think Aye would say first?

Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. Could you tell me [[what love is|C1whatlove]]?
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I [[seek friends|C1seekfriends]].&quot;
Aye: Hi. I&#39;m Aye. I don&#39;t understand feelings. Maybe you do? I know all of Wikipedia and more. I&#39;m told you know barely a fraction of this. How do you deal with being so [[stupid|C1studpid]]?

<tw-passagedata pid="13" name="ethicsloneliness" tags="optional" position="293.33333333333337,973.3333333333334">Please talk with a classmate about how you feel about us programming Aye with a baseline of loneliness. Was this important for our project? How come? Do you believe it was ethical or unethical? If so, how?

OK, if you want to send us a summary of some of your ideas regarding this important issue in AI research ethics, please send your feedback to AIethicsQuestion@takeastand.org.

Please proceed with Aye to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].
