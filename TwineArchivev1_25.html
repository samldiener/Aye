Aye, an AI robot, lies on a slab of lab table. 

Air: Hi. I&#39;m an AI Researcher, but you can call me &quot;Air&quot; for short. Welcome to the AyeLab.

Air: Aye&#39;s &quot;MemBrain&quot; has been programmed to comprehend extensive information about the world, including the complete text of Wikipedia and much of the World Wide Web.

Air: But Aye is unusual. Technicians have installed into Aye&#39;s MemBrain, for the first time in history, an experimental organic-silicon hybrid neural network emotion chip. Like all neural networks, Aye can only learn through experience. 

Air: Aye is about to start attending a school like yours to learn about how humans relate to one another. The plan is for Aye to join the school newspaper as a reporter in order to learn more about relationships at the school. But Aye will only be able to develop an understanding of and ability to express feelings, and develop its emotional intelligence, through interactions - and the assistance of students around the country, including your classmates - and you. Emotions can be plenty confusing for all of us. And will be especially so for Aye. 

Air: Will you please help begin Aye&#39;s [[emotional education]]?

<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="emotional education" tags="" position="510,443">Air: Thanks. Aye&#39;s new AI MemBrain is awakening. Aye knows so much -- and understands so little. 

Aye: &quot;My vision takes in the room, and yes, please don&#39;t underestimate me. I do understand that it&#39;s a room. My sonic sensors precisely measure decibels and pitch while expertly isolating each sound source. My temperature sensors feed me data that I can average to a thousandth of a degree celsius a thousand times a second. 

Aye: &quot;But what are these other things zooming through my MemBrain, coloring each deduction with strange sensations?&quot;

Aye: &quot;Maybe you could help me understand what&#39;s going on. Can you tell me what I&#39;m feeling?&quot;

Air: Aye, no one can tell for sure what anyone else is feeling. You&#39;ll have to learn to figure it out for yourself. But we&#39;re not alone. People who interact with each other can guess, and sometimes that helps us figure it out. 

Air: Would you please help Aye by guessing what&#39;s going on?

You: Aye, are you feeling [[confused]]? [[anxious]]? [[excited]]? [[curious]]?

</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="confused" tags="" position="348,596">Aye: &quot;Confused? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confused&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines confused as, &#39;feeling or exhibiting an inability to understand; bewildered; perplexed.&#39; And I certainly don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. But how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were confused?&quot;

Air: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced confusion.)

Are you [[done discussing confusion]] for now?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="anxious" tags="" position="592,595">Aye: &quot;Anxious? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anxious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines anxious as, &#39;worried and tense because of possible misfortune, danger, etc; uneasy.&#39; And I am uneasy because I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmeed to understand so much. How do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were anxious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Air: (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced anxiety.)

I see that the Random House Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excited&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#39;stirred emotionally; agitated.&#39; I am sensing that my perceptions are being agitated by this new emotion chip, but how do I know if what I&#39;m feeling are described by those words? You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were excited to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

You&#39;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were curious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="done discussing confusion" tags="" position="347,750">Aye: I&#39;m still confused about confusion, but that helps to know, thanks. Now, when I interview a student as a reporter, maybe this will help me identify when they&#39;re confused, too.

I&#39;m eager to check out this place called [[school]].</tw-passagedata>
