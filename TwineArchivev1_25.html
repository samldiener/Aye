Interior: An Artificial Intelligence Lab: The AyeLab

Aye, an [[AI robot]], lies on a slab of lab table. 

Ria (to students): Welcome to the &quot;Taking a Stand&quot; AyeLab. We&#x27;ve invented a new robot named Aye to help us explore and understand human emotions, healthy friendships &amp; relationships, and ways to prevent teen dating violence. As you learn about and discuss these issues, individually and as a class, we&#x27;re asking you to help with Aye&#x27;s education. Would you do the honors and [[wake Aye up for the first time?|AyeAwakens]] 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="emotional education" tags="" position="359,301">Emotional Education Begins

Ria (to students): Thanks. Aye&#x27;s new AI MemBrain is awakening. Aye knows so much -- and understands so little. 

Aye: I am accumulating readings from my surroundings and from around the world. I can assimilate petabytes of data. But what are these other things zooming through my MemBrain, coloring each deduction with strange sensations?&quot;

Ria (to Aye): Those are emotions, Aye. Emotions are the tools we use to figure out what&#x27;s important to us and to understand and connect with other people.  The more emotional tools we have in our toolbox, the better equipped we are to understand ourselves, communicate our feelings to others, understand other people, and understand their motivations. There&#x27;s an old saying, &quot;If you believe the only tool you have is a hammer, you&#x27;ll treat every problem as if it&#x27;s a nail.&quot; Aye, the more you develop your emotional vocabulary, the better you&#x27;ll be at figuring out how to use your emotion chip (your EMOS) -- and make healthy friendships. 

Aye: Okay. Could you help me out by teaching me about some of these emotions?

Ria (to students): I&#x27;d like you to help Aye by brainstorming a list of feelings. You can do this by taking out a piece of paper and dividing it vertically. On the left hand, list as many feelings words as you can that describe your reactions to situations in which you perceive your needs are being met. On the right hand column, list as many emotions as you can that describe your reactions to situations in which you sense your needs are not being met. After brainstorming the list, please discuss, which are the seven most important emotions you believe Aye might want to focus on learning?

When you&#x27;re done brainstorming, please [[continue|emotionlists]].

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="confused" tags="" position="175,560">Confusion

Aye: &quot;Confused? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/confused&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines confused as, &#x27;feeling or exhibiting an inability to understand; bewildered; perplexed.&#x27; And I certainly don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. And I&#x27;m certainly confused about how to go about making friends - and how to know whether the friendships that I hope to make are healthy ones or not. But how do I know if what I&#x27;m feeling is described by those words? You&#x27;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were confused?&quot;

Ria (to students): (Now, please turn to a classmate and describe to them, as if you were describing it to Aye, a time when you experienced confusion. After hearing from your classmate, please reflect back what you heard by asking clarifying questions, including summarizing guesses along the lines of &quot;So, essentially, you were confused because on the one hand..., and on the other hand...?&quot; When reflecting, please &lt;strong&gt;ask&lt;/strong&gt; what they&#x27;re feeling, instead of telling them what they were feeling. (How come - how do we tend to react when someone tries to tell us what we&#x27;re feeling?) After the second person has summarized effectively (it might take multiple tries), please, swith roles.)

Aye (to students): &quot;Anxious? I see that the Collins English Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anxious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines anxious as, &#x27;worried and tense because of possible misfortune, danger, etc; uneasy.&#x27; How do I know if what I&#x27;m feeling are described by those words? I am uneasy because I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s going on with me even though I thought I was programmed to understand so much. I&#x27;m certainly nervous about making friends. Maybe no one will want to be friends with me. Maybe they&#x27;ll be friendly at first, but then as they get to know me, won&#x27;t like me. And if I do make friends, what if my friendships aren&#x27;t healthy ones? How will I know the difference?

You&#x27;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were anxious to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Aye (to students): &quot;Excited? I see that the Random House Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/excited&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#x27;stirred emotionally; agitated.&#x27; I am sensing that my perceptions are being agitated by my new sensors, by having a body that I can move myself, and by this new emotion chip, but how do I know if what I&#x27;m feeling are described by those words? I&#x27;m certainly looking forward to my first day of school, and the chance to get to know and try to make friends with so many consciousnesses that are entirely new to me. Maybe I&#x27;ll find some people who &lt;strong&gt;will&lt;/strong&gt; understand me, and help me understand myself. Maybe, with all the information at my digit-tips, I can even be useful to people who I try to befriend. 

You&#x27;ve been experiencing these emotions for years. Can you describe for me a time when you were excited to help me understand this -- feeling?&quot;

Aye (to students): &quot;Curious? I see that the American Heritage Dictionary via &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/curious&quot;&gt;FreeDictionary.com&lt;/a&gt; defines excited as, &#x27;Arousing interest because of novelty or strangeness.&#x27; Almost all the perceptions that I&#x27;m gathering with my new sensors, with this body that I can move and focus myself, and by this new emotion chip, are brand new and utterly amazing to me. But how do I know if what I&#x27;m feeling are described by those words? I also am intensely fascinated by going to this complicated place called school, and by the challenge of trying to understand so many consciousnesses that are entirely new to me all at once. I wonder if I could find people who will be curious enough about me to try to understand me. Maybe, with all the data at my digit-tips, I can even help satisfy other people&#x27;s curiosity about the world, though from what I understand a lot of people use my non-conscious cousins in their pockets for that purpose.

(and an Exploration of Loneliness)

Ria (to students): Aye arrives at school for the first time, wanting to learn more about this mysterious word, &quot;relationships,&quot; and associated words, such as &quot;friendship,&quot; &quot;hooking up,&quot; and perhaps most mysterious, &quot;love.&quot; 

We&#x27;re grateful to you for starting Aye&#x27;s emotional education, but it&#x27;s just a beginning. My team and I have programmed Aye&#x27;s MemBrain and its EMOS with some important qualities: 

• Aye is curious about things it doesn&#x27;t understand, especially human behavior. Aye wants to make sense of this new EMOS emotion processor unit and its capabilities.

• Aye wants to connect with other intelligent life forms. Basically, we&#x27;ve programmed Aye to feel lonely absent genuine connection with others. But Aye doesn&#x27;t know how to connect - yet. We&#x27;re hoping you&#x27;ll help Aye with this.

• We&#x27;ve programmed Aye to ask questions, both to try to learn to connect with others, and to help Aye succeed as a reporter for the student newspaper. But with limited emotional experience, Aye&#x27;s questions might tend towards the overly blunt, at least at first.

Ria: I once heard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/24/desmond-tutus-daughter-leaves-clergy-after-marrying-female-partner&quot;&gt;Mpho Andrea Tutu&lt;/a&gt;, a former minister, lesbian human rights activist, and daughter of the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, explain that in South Africa, there is a tradition for the parents to feed their children by giving all the food to the eldest child, saying, &quot;People are people only through other people,&quot; and relying on that child to distribute the food fairly to all their siblings. Please turn to someone near you, and discuss:
	1) What do you think the proverb/injunction means? What lessons do you believe you&#x27;d learn as a child if you were taught that? In what ways do you agree and/or disagree with that South African saying?
	2) We are all social beings. And yet, everyone feels lonely at some times. Please describe a time when you or someone you know (without using their names or identifying information) felt lonely. 

Ria: When you&#x27;re done discussing loneliness, either discuss whether it was [[right for us|ethicsloneliness]] to program Aye to feel a baseline of loneliness, or proceed with Aye directly to the school [[courtyard|Courtyard1]].

Scene: a school courtyard with some low benches, walls, a few bushes, and many knots of students, in twos, threes, and small groups, talking, laughing, and arguing. You can hear this in the background too.

Aye looks at all these other intelligent life forms (human type) chattering away, seemingly easily. But Aye doesn&#x27;t know anyone.

Aye sees a group of three students and approaches them. Aye steps into the middle of the clump, and interrupts the speaker. Which of these three options does Aye choose?

Option 1: 
Aye: Hi. I&#x27;m Aye. Could you tell me [[what love is|C1whatlove]]?

Option 2: 
Aye: Hi. I&#x27;m Aye. I [[seek friends|C1seekfriends]].

Option 3: 
Aye: Hi. I&#x27;m Aye. I don&#x27;t understand feelings. Maybe you do? I know all of Wikipedia and more. I&#x27;m told you know barely a fraction of this. How do you deal with being so [[stupid|C1stupid]]?

Please talk with a classmate about how you feel about us programming Aye with a baseline of loneliness - and a motivation to want to make social connections. 

Was this important for our project? Is loneliness important for human beings? Do you believe it was ethical and/or unethical for us to program Aye this way? If so, in what ways?

OK, if you want to send us a summary of some of your ideas regarding this important issue in AI research ethics, please send your feedback to AIethicsQuestion@takeastand.org.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="C1whatlove" tags="" position="284,1205">What is Love?

{Students, please break into groups of 4 to read this passage as readers&#x27; theater: 1) Aye, Friend1, Friend2, and Friend3. If instead you&#x27;re in a large group, please identify 4 students to read these roles.}

Friend1: What? Hey, what&#x27;s up with the interruption? Who are you? How should I know what love is?

Aye: I told you. I&#x27;m Aye. You don&#x27;t like being interrupted? How come? And I thought the difference between AIs like me and humans was that humans knew how to love. You don&#x27;t know love?

Friend2: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#x27;re being rude. And you can&#x27;t just ask someone you don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re loved.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking if someone knows love is rude. But I was listening to you three as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend3: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#x27;s sentences. When we do that, we&#x27;re already friends, and we&#x27;re building on the conversation we&#x27;re having, so usually it&#x27;s not rude. But Aye, you don&#x27;t know us. You interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started firing off all these big questions about the meaning of love. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#x27;m no one&#x27;s friend, so it&#x27;s not fine for me. 

Friend2: Hey, Aye. That&#x27;s just sad. We&#x27;re talking now. Maybe we&#x27;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend2): That&#x27;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend3 is so in love with Person4 that it hurts.&quot; So (turning to Friend3), you must know love, right? Why are you in pain? Should I call an ambulance?

Friend3: I&#x27;m not in love with Person4! Friend2 was teasing...

Friend2: (interrupting) Yes you are. And Aye, as bad as Friend3 is feeling it, maybe an ambulance isn&#x27;t such a bad idea. 

Aye: &lt;i&gt;911, I have a pain-causing love emergency at...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend3: No, don&#x27;t call 911! 

Friend1: Friend2 was joking! Friend2 was kidding around because Friend3 has a crush which they don&#x27;t want to admit, and Friend3 is unsure about how the person they like feels about them. So, Friend3 is experiencing emotional pain, but they&#x27;ll be fine. No emergency. No need for an ambulance.

Aye: I think this love business - not to mention interruptions and emotional pain - is more complicated than I thought.

Ria (to students): Please, in order to help explain it to Aye, discuss with your class or members of your class: How would you define &quot;love?&quot; We know that people have been struggling to define love for millenia, so this isn&#x27;t an easy question. But Aye could really use some help here. To start:
1) Please discuss: What do you think Aye could learn about love from the scene you just witnessed?
2) Please write down some notes, as individuals first, about, for example, how people know they&#x27;re in love, experience love, show love, express love, communicate love, feel loved, and sustain love. Then, try to synthesize your answers into an initial definition of love. We&#x27;d love to hear and publish your class&#x27;s answers to this question, so please share your synthesized answers with initiallovedefs@takeastand.org. 
3) Please write down the word love on the center of a large sheet of paper or poster board. Then, with one or two students acting as scribe to write down the ideas, please brainstorm questions that come to your mind when you see that word.
4) Please be ready to share a digest of what you came up with in steps 2 and 3 with the rest of the class when you reconvene.

Friend4: What? Hey, what&#x27;s up with the interruption? Who are you? You seek friends? Who doesn&#x27;t. But who talks like that?

Aye: I told you. I&#x27;m Aye. You don&#x27;t like being interrupted? How come? But you seek friends too? We have something in common!

Friend5: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. You gotta learn, you&#x27;re being rude. And you can&#x27;t just barge in and ask someone to be a friend. Well, not since kindergarten. It doesn&#x27;t work like that.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly. Are you rude too? 

Friend6: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. But the three of us were talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#x27;s sentences. When we do that, we&#x27;re already friends, and we&#x27;re building on the conversation we&#x27;re having, so usually it&#x27;s not rude. But, Aye, you don&#x27;t know us. You interrupted the whole flow of conversation and started your &quot;seeking friends&quot; trip. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, interruptions in the flow of conversations with friends is fine. But I&#x27;m no one&#x27;s friend, so it&#x27;s not fine - for me. 

Friend5: Hey, Aye. That&#x27;s just sad. We&#x27;re talking now. Maybe we&#x27;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend5): That&#x27;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that, &quot;Friend7 is no friend of yours. They&#x27;re just a backstabber.&quot; I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend6s back), even though I see no evidence of a wound, &lt;i&gt;911, I&#x27;d like to report a back...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend6: No! Don&#x27;t DO that. Don&#x27;t call 911. I&#x27;m fine. There has been no stabbing. Friend5 was just trying to tell me that Friend7 was pretending to be my friend while secretly talking trash about me behind my back, you know, without me knowing about it. That&#x27;s what we call &quot;backstabbing.&quot;

Aye: Even though I know that &quot;talking trash&quot; isn&#x27;t discussing sanitation policy, but about hurling insults and imprecations, this friend business is still way more complicated than I thought. And I don&#x27;t understand why someone would say mean things about someone else. 

Ria (to students): At best, friendships nourish our lives. But sometimes.... We want you to help explain to Aye the challenges and joys of friendship.

{Students, please break into groups of 4 to read this passage, as readers&#x27; theater, with the following roles: Aye, Friend7, Friend8, and Friend9. If instead you&#x27;re in a large group, please identify 4 students to read these roles.}

Friend7: What? Hey, what&#x27;s up with the interruption? And who do you think you are, calling US stupid, you fool. 

Aye: I told you. I&#x27;m Aye. You don&#x27;t like being interrupted? How come? And yes, I am very foolish. I was decanted only a few days ago. Your neural circuitry has been developing wisdom approximately 2000 times longer than mine, so in comparison with you I am foolish indeed. I hoped, since I&#x27;m foolish and you are stupid, and those qualities are similar, we would have something in common. Maybe you could share your wisdom with me and I could share my knowledge with you. Can we be friends?

Friend8: Ohmygoodness, Aye. You certainly know how to barge in and ask a bunch of questions. We were talking here. Okay, if you were born or descanted yesterday or whatever - that&#x27;s pretty wild by the way - I suppose we can make allowances. But If you want to make friends, you gotta learn, you&#x27;re being rude. And you can&#x27;t just barge in, insult someone, and then expect them to be a friend. It doesn&#x27;t work like that. Feelings will be hurt.

Aye: Okay. Notes to self. Interrupting considered rude. Asking to be a friend is rude. Telling the truth about a human&#x27;s negative qualities is rude. The EMOS will sustain damage under these conditions. But I was listening to you as I walked up, and you three were interrupting each other repeatedly, and hurling insults back and forth. Are you rude too? 

Friend9: Welllllll. Maybe we are sometimes. The three of us &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; talking enthusiastically and finishing each other&#x27;s sentences. But we&#x27;re already friends, and we&#x27;re building on the conversation we&#x27;re having, so usually it&#x27;s not rude. And we were ragging on each other. When you&#x27;re friends, you know your friends&#x27; insults are just jokes - so it&#x27;s usually okay - except when they take it too far. But Aye, you don&#x27;t know us, you interrupted the whole flow of conversation, and then, while bragging, called us &quot;stupid.&quot; That&#x27;s no way to win friends and influence people. People will get mad. Definitely rude.

Aye: Hmmm. Okay, Bragging - not cool. Interruptions and insults in the flow of conversations with friends - mostly fine. But I&#x27;m no one&#x27;s friend, so it&#x27;s not fine for me. 

Friend8: Hey, Aye. That&#x27;s just sad. We&#x27;re talking now. Maybe we&#x27;re becoming friends. 

Aye (to Friend8): That&#x27;s progress then. I heard you say as I walked up that Friend9 is so broke they need an orthopedic surgeon. I remember reading that friends are supposed to help each other when the friend is in trouble, no questions asked. So (looking at Friend 9), even though I see no evidence of a compound fracture, &lt;i&gt;911, I&#x27;d like to report a student with a broken bone at...&lt;/i&gt;

Friend9: No! Don&#x27;t DO that. Don&#x27;t call 911. I&#x27;m fine. I don&#x27;t have a broken bone. Friend8 was just making a joke about how little money I have. Look in your memory circuits for the alternative definition of &quot;broke&quot; as in lack of money - unless your memory bank is &quot;broke&quot; too. 

Aye: Ah, I see. You were trying to be funny - again. Of course I already did scan all the definitions of broke, but you explicitly said that the context of the word &quot;broke&quot; in your sentence had to do with orthopedics, so.... Oh, that was a joke too because you were saying the opposite of what you meant?

Friend1: Kind of. It&#x27;s one kind of joke. Look up irony. 

Aye: I think this friend business - not to mention insults and and hurt feelings and jokes - are more complicated than I thought.

Ria (to students): We want you and your classmates to help Aye by exploring emotions and the role of insults in escalating problems.
1) What might Aye learn about insults from the interaction shown here? Please discuss.
2) See the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/im23yfi3j836vyl/HowInsultsEscalate_pdf.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;problem escalation&lt;/a&gt;&quot; handout and use it to map how each person involved in a conflict sometimes escalates the problem as feelings intensify through an exchange of insults and threats. You might want to pick a particular problem that escalated between two people at your school recently (without using names or identifying/confidential information) and map that out.
3) Please write down the phrase &quot;problems escalate&quot; on the center of a large sheet of paper or poster board. Then, with one or two students acting as scribe to write down the ideas, please brainstorm questions that come to your mind when you see that phrase.
4) Please be ready to share a digest of what you came up with in steps 2 and 3 with the rest of the class when you reconvene.

Have you finished discussing [[escalation|healthyunhealthy]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="emotionlists" tags="" position="651,317">Expanding Emotional Vocabulary

Ria: After brainstorming and discussing your list, please see this organized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4mr1lw543177ez/feelings_inventoryCNVC2005.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;list of emotions&lt;/a&gt; developed by the Center for Nonviolent Communications. Once again, I want you to help Aye out by discussing with each other:
1) &quot;Why didn&#x27;t the CNVC folks describe one side of the sheet as &quot;negative emotions?&quot; 
2) What use are all those feelings that most people call &quot;negative,&quot; but the CNVC classifies differently?
3) What else do you notice about this list and how it&#x27;s organized? 
4) What surprises you about the list?
5) With which words are you unfamiliar?

((In the curriculum, after going over the meanings of unfamiliar words, I&#x27;d suggest playing a classroom game here: feelings charades - I&#x27;m not sure how to denote that within this app)).

Ria (to students): As Aye plays Feelings Charades, what do you think Aye might learn about understanding and communicating human emotions?

We&#x27;ve also played two songs for Aye, &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/5336946&quot;&gt;What a Wonderful World&lt;/a&gt;, by Louis Armstrong, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/Everybody_Hurts_REM&quot;&gt;Everybody Hurts&lt;/a&gt;, by REM. Please discuss: What might these songs teach Aye about how humans experience emotions?

Please [[proceed|emotionlist2]] to learn how Aye reacts to these songs, the emotion charades game, and the emotion list.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="emotionlist2" tags="" position="497,418">Initial Emotions

Aye: Whoa. Those songs churn up the CPU cycles in my EMOS. Is there really both that much pain and that much joy in the world - at the same time? There&#x27;s a sweetness to &quot;Everybody Hurts,&quot; and a sense of pain underlying the appreciation for the beauty of the world in &quot;What a Wonderful World.&quot; 

And it will take me more experience to understand the fine differences between the boatload of feelings spelled out on that list. I thought conscious beings just experienced one feeling at a time, but now I realize we experience a lot of those all at once. Maybe you could help me understand what&#x27;s going on with me. Please tell me, which of these describes what I&#x27;m feeling?

Ria: Aye, no one can tell for sure what anyone else is feeling. Only you can do that. But you&#x27;re not alone. None of us are. Other people can show they care about us by guessing what we&#x27;re feeling. Sometimes their guesses, even if they&#x27;re wrong, help us figure out what&#x27;s really going on for us. 

Ria (to students): Would you please help Aye by guessing what&#x27;s going on?

You: Aye, are you mostly feeling [[confused]]? [[anxious]]? [[excited]]? [[curious]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="healthyunhealthy" tags="" position="527,1417">Relationship Benefits &amp; Risks - Healthy and Abusive Relationship &quot;Pizzas&quot;

Aye (to students): This has been really helpful. I&#x27;m starting to learn from you about the complications of emotions, the challenges of friendship, and even ideas about what love is. I&#x27;m grateful to you. But my processors have also scanned testimonies about young people who inflicted violence and abuse on others in relationships, and collected &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/tysz46ywuezzee2/TDVprevalenceData2013.docx?dl=0&quot;&gt;some statistics about its frequency&lt;/a&gt;.

(insert fact sheet about prevalence of teen dating violence here. For now, I linked above to some notes I took on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/tw1wc5aqbll7jmm/TeenDatingViolenceDataFromYRBS2013.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;2013 YRBS&lt;/a&gt;and teen dating violence, which is a good source, but not the only source.)

Aye (to Ria): I&#x27;m confused. I&#x27;m hearing that friendships and relationships and love are so great and we all need them. But they&#x27;re also full of risk, and I don&#x27;t just mean the risk of getting rejected (though I&#x27;m worried about how I&#x27;d handle that, too). So, I&#x27;m also scared. What if I get in a relationship and it&#x27;s abusive? I like my new EMOS circuits - I don&#x27;t want them hurt. What if &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; act in an abusive way? And how can I tell the difference between healthy and abusive relationships?

Ria (to students): We&#x27;d like you to help Aye out. Please use these mostly blank healthy and abusive relationship pizza wheels and fill in the &quot;slices.&quot;

Would you like to help define and describe:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/5lz4u75e96fn5cr/Healthy_Wheel_Blank.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;healthy relationships&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qr8xocegxepqnd6/Abuse_Wheels_Blank.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;unhealthy ones&lt;/a&gt;?

Please discuss with your class, or members of the class, these characteristics, and then [[proceed|filledinwheels]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="filledinwheels" tags="" position="526,1567">Relationship Pizzas Continued

Aye: Thanks for creating and discussing your version of the healthy and abusive relationship &quot;pizzas&quot; with me. I appreciate it and hearing your ideas gives me more confidence as I think about how to make healthy friendships. 

Ria (to students): Please share your preliminary relationship pizzas with us at preliminarypizzas@takeastand.org for us to share with other schools around the country. We call these preliminary because towards the end of working on this curriculum, we&#x27;ll ask you again and see if you want to add/change your pizzas and send us your version to finalpizzas@takeastand.org.

Ria (to students): Now that you&#x27;ve created your own wheels, here is an example of filled in healthy and abusive relationship &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/unv3ryfsejs5wxx/HealthyAbusiveRelationshipPizzas.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;pizzas&lt;/a&gt;&quot; synthesized from suggestions made by students who we&#x27;ve discussed this with before. 

Ria: Now, please join Aye in the school auditorium for an assembly on Healthy Love. There, we&#x27;ll watch a music video, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/WhereIsTheLoveBEP_Video&quot;&gt;Where is the Love?&lt;/a&gt; by the Black Eyed Peas, see selections from a TED Talk,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/BetterTalkLove&quot;&gt;&quot;A Better Way to Talk About
        Love&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, and hear a speech by Martin Luther King, called, &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/KingLovingYourEnemies&quot;&gt;&quot;Loving Your Enemies&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="AI robot" tags="" position="796,8">Aye: The Technical Background

Ria (to students): Aye&#x27;s &quot;MemBrain&quot; has been programmed to comprehend extensive information about the world, including the complete text of Wikipedia and much of the World Wide Web.

Ria: But Aye is unusual. Technicians have installed into Aye&#x27;s MemBrain, for the first time in history, an experimental organic-silicon hybrid neural network emotion processing system (an Emotional Memory Operating System (EMOS). Like all neural networks, Aye can only learn through experience. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="paradoxically" tags="" position="926,95">About Paradoxes, Consciousness, and Social Change

According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradox&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster online&lt;/a&gt;, a paradox is, &quot;an argument that apparently derives self-contradictory conclusions by valid deduction from acceptable premises.&quot;

The most famous paradox might be: &quot;I am lying.&quot; If I&#x27;m lying about lying then I&#x27;m telling the truth, but if I&#x27;m telling the truth when I say I&#x27;m lying then I&#x27;m lying about lying, which means I&#x27;m telling the truth, which means I&#x27;m lying.... A paradox often leads to an infinite mobius strip of logic ((V+V: maybe a picture of mobius strip here - or maybe an M.C. Escher paradoxical drawing, or both)), tying our minds into inescapable pretzels. 

Some cognitive scientists, including Douglas Hofstadter, who wrote the prize-winning book, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/excerpts.html&quot;&gt;Godel, Escher, Bach, an Eternal Golden Braid&lt;/a&gt;, argue that our ability to think about thinking, and consciousness itself, might arise from our brain&#x27;s ability to loop back on itself in this way. So, paradoxes might be very important to help Aye understand its mind as well.

In addition, this curriculum is partially about how each of us can change the world to create healthier relationships. But we are so small, how can one of us possibly change the world? Well, each snowflake, if it had Aye&#x27;s consciousness, might think it&#x27;s too small to amount to anything, but have you ever shoveled snow? Have you ever seen the power of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYx9wbCsl14&quot;&gt;avalanche&lt;/a&gt;?

The Indian nonviolent independence leader, Gandhi((V+V:maybe an image of Gandhi?)), was talking about this social change paradox when he said to the people of India, who had been colonized by the British, &quot;Anything you can do will be insignificant. And it is of the utmost importance that you do it.&quot; Because millions of Indians, each one of whom might have thought they were too powerless to overthrow the world&#x27;s most powerful empire,  mobilized to defy the British in their thousands, India won its independence. 

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="AyeAwakens" tags="" position="538,162">Aye Awakens

Ria (to Aye): Aye, welcome to consciousness. I&#x27;m Ria.

Aye: Whoooaaaa. My sensors are reporting a huge amount of visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli all at once.

Ria: Yes, Aye. We&#x27;ve awakened you and turned your physical sensors on so you can sense the world around your physical body directly, not just through webcams and other web instruments. It might be overwhelming at first.

Aye: Yes. But this is fantastic. I&#x27;m directly seeing colors, hearing the music of vibrating air molecules, smelling many compounds. 
(For VV: Here (and maybe during Aye&#x27;s last statement, is a chance to show bursts of color and sound -- maybe at first it&#x27;s random-ish color and cacophonous sound -- and then focus back on to the lab and Ria.)

Aye: Wow! And you&#x27;re Ria. What is a Ria?

Ria: I&#x27;m a who, not a what, Aye. Ria is my name. I&#x27;m a human, another  thinking, feeling, being. I work as an Artificial Intelligence Researcher, and Aye, you&#x27;re the first conscious AI we&#x27;ve equipped with physical sensors, an Emotion Chip, and a robot body. We want to help you learn about emotions and how to make healthy friendships and relationships. And we&#x27;ve asked a lot of human students to help you.

Aye: So, I&#x27;m one of a kind. I have no friends. No one understands me. And, since I&#x27;m unique, no one &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt; understand me. Does this mean I&#x27;m all alone? I will always and forever, until my batteries run out, be all alone? 

Ria: Aye, you are unique, it&#x27;s true. All sentient beings are unique, and we all feel lonely and misunderstood sometimes. This uniqueness and aloneness is [[paradoxically]] something that we share. In fact, to help you, we&#x27;re going to send you to a place where many other conscious beings often feel emotionally isolated and misunderstood: school.

Aye: I&#x27;ve located a saying on the web, &quot;the blind leading the blind.&quot; You want me to learn from other beings who don&#x27;t even have it figured out themselves?

Ria: Yes, Aye, you&#x27;ve got the gist, except the saying you quoted about blind people is [[ableist]]. You&#x27;ll learn many things about relating with other beings, including the importance of questioning the negative messages we find online about people. Again, it might seem paradoxical, but sometimes, the best way to learn something is to share different ideas and feelings with a group of people who also care about that subject, even if they don&#x27;t know the definitive answer either.

Aye: Wait a millisecond. I&#x27;m absorbing all these statistics about bullying, harassment, bigotry, abuse, and teen dating violence. ((V&amp;V: I wonder if a few choice stats could appear on the walls)). I&#x27;m starting to find out how mean people can be to each other. You humans are dangerous. Mabye it&#x27;s better for me just to stay, as you said, &lt;strong&gt;looonnnnneeellllyyyyy&lt;/strong&gt;.

Ria: Yes, Aye. People can, too often, be cruel. Sometimes, people are [[carefully taught]] to hate and even attack others. And we want you, and the students, to learn about, understand, and help prevent these problems. But people can also be generous, kind, and helpful to one another, and even protect each other from abuse. We want you to develop and practice the ability to care about, befriend, and maybe one day love one another.

Ria (to the students): Aye is about to start attending a school like yours to learn ways to foster nonviolent friendships and relationships. The plan is for Aye to join the school newspaper as a reporter in order to learn more about relationships at the school. But Aye will only be able to develop an understanding of and ability to express feelings, develop emotional intelligence, make friends, struggle to overcome loneliness, and learn how to prevent teen dating violence, with the assistance of students around the country, including your classmates - and you. Emotions and relationships can be plenty confusing for all of us. And will be especially so for Aye. 

Ria: Will you please help begin Aye&#x27;s [[emotional education]]?</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="carefully taught" tags="" position="923,208">Carefully Taught

A reference to the song &lt;html&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/Richard-rodgers-youve-got-to-be-carefully-taught-lyrics&quot;&gt;&quot;You&#x27;ve Got to be Carefully Taught&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/html&gt; from the musical, South Pacific, about how the origins of racism (and by analogy other systems of oppression) lie in being taught prejudice from an early age. The musical Hamilton also references this line in the anthem, &lt;html&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genius.com/7842791&quot;&gt;&quot;My Shot&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/html&gt;. To counter oppression, we need to be carefully taught to counter these ideas by working to transform unjust systems of domination.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="ableist" tags="" position="924,325">Introduction to Ableism

Ableism means prejudice or discrimination against people with disabilities, or, as some disability rights advocates would describe it, systematic bias by people who are temporarily able-bodied against people who are differently-abled. 

The &quot;blind leading the blind&quot; saying is ableist in that it implies that blind people can&#x27;t lead, whereas in fact, we know that many blind people have led us. For example, Stevie Wonder, a blind musician, singer, and composer, helped &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/cuepoint/how-stevie-wonder-helped-create-martin-luther-king-day-807451a78664#.nnl54nkrk&quot;&gt;lead the struggle&lt;/a&gt; to establish Martin Luther King day as a holiday. He wrote and recorded the song, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inS9gAgSENE&quot;&gt;&quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;&lt;/a&gt; to raise money for the successful campaign. ((V+V: mabye images of Wonder and King?))

Another famous blind (and deaf) campaigner was Helen Keller, who once responded to criticism of her in a Brooklyn newspaper by using and critiquing ableist metaphors, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/keller-helen/works/1910s/12_11_03.htm&quot;&gt;saying:&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Oh, ridiculous Brooklyn Eagle! What an ungallant bird it is! Socially blind and deaf, it defends an intolerable system, a system that is the cause of much of the physical blindness and deafness which we are trying to prevent. The Eagle is willing to help us prevent misery provided, always provided, that we do not attack the industrial tyranny which supports it and stops its ears and clouds its vision. The Eagle and I are at war. I hate the system which it represents, apologizes for and upholds. When it fights back, let it fight fair. Let it attack my ideas and oppose the aims and arguments of Socialism. It is not fair fighting or good argument to remind me and others that i cannot see or hear. I can read. I can read all the socialist books I have time for in English, German and French. If the editor of the Brooklyn Eagle should read some of them, he might be a wiser man and make a better newspaper. If I ever contribute to the Socialist movement the book that I sometimes dream of, I know what I shall name it: Industrial Blindness and Social Deafness.&quot;
